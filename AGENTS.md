# General rules for the project

A collection of Agent Skills.

## Mandatory Rules

### Repository Safety

- DO NOT create, amend, squash, rebase,
  or otherwise modify existing commits.
- DO NOT switch branches.
- DO NOT perform any network git operations
  inside this repository
  (e.g. `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`).
- You MAY use `git stash` if necessary,
  but clean up after yourself.
- You MAY use `git restore` for reverting local changes.
- Do not delete, rewrite, or mass-modify files
  outside the explicit scope of the task.
- Avoid destructive shell commands
  (e.g. `rm -rf`, recursive operations)
  unless explicitly required.

### Coding Standards

#### Semantic Linefeeds (comments and documentation only)

Start each sentence on a new line.
Break long sentences at natural pauses —
after commas, semicolons, conjunctions,
or between logical clauses.
Do NOT hard-wrap to a fixed column width.
The goal is meaningful diffs:
one changed idea = one changed line.

NOTE: The above example does not mean you should break into very short lines as shown.

#### Documentation (markdown)

- Write new documentation in English.
- Avoid adding new documentation
  unless specifically requested by user.
- Update existing documentation together with code changes
  ONLY if otherwise existing documentation became incorrect.
- Keep lines within 96 characters.
  Do NOT break semantically single line unless it won't fit into 96 characters.
